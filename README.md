# Python Programming Course Examples

This directory contains Python example programs created for a custom Python programming course. Each script demonstrates fundamental Python concepts and programming techniques suitable for beginners learning Python.

## Program Descriptions

1. **hello_world.py**
   Prints a simple "Hello World" message to the console, introducing basic output in Python.

2. **receiving_input.py**
   Demonstrates how to receive and process user input, displaying a personalized greeting.

3. **type_conversion.py**
   Shows how to convert user input (string) to an integer to calculate a person's age based on their birth year.

4. **strings.py**
   Explores string manipulation methods such as converting case, finding characters, and replacing substrings.

5. **arithmetic_operations.py**
   Illustrates basic arithmetic operations in Python, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

6. **if_statements.py**
   Introduces conditional logic using if-else statements to handle different scenarios (e.g., weather conditions).

7. **weight_converter.py**
   A program that converts weight between pounds and kilograms based on user input, demonstrating conditional logic and arithmetic.

8. **while_loops.py**
   Uses a while loop to print a pattern of asterisks, showcasing iterative control flow.

9. **guessing_game.py**
   Implements a simple number guessing game using a while loop and conditional statements.

10. **car_game.py**
    A text-based car simulation game that responds to user commands like start, stop, and quit, demonstrating loops and state management.

11. **for_loops.py**
    Demonstrates the use of for loops to iterate over a list of names.

12. **lists.py**
    Shows how to work with lists, including accessing, modifying, and printing list elements.

13. **dictionaries.py**
    Introduces dictionaries by creating and accessing key-value pairs for a customer object.

14. **emoji_converter.py**
    Defines a function to convert text-based smileys (e.g., ":)") into emoji characters, showcasing dictionaries and string processing.

15. **functions.py**
    Demonstrates how to define and call a simple function to greet a user by name.

16. **exceptions.py**
    Shows basic error handling using try-except blocks to manage invalid inputs and division by zero.

17. **classes.py**
    Introduces object-oriented programming by defining a simple class with methods.

18. **inheritance.py**
    Demonstrates class inheritance by extending a base class (Mammal) with a derived class (Dog).

19. **modules.py**
    Provides a placeholder example for importing and using custom modules (requires a separate module file).

20. **random_values.py**
    Generates random numbers using the random module, illustrating basic randomization.

## How to Use

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
2. Navigate to this directory in your terminal.
3. Run any script using the command:
   ```bash
   python3 <script_name>.py
Replace <script_name> with the name of the Python file (e.g., hello_world.py).
Requirements
Python 3.x
No additional dependencies are required for most scripts, except for random_values.py, which uses the built-in random module.
Notes
These programs are designed as learning examples and are kept simple for educational purposes.
Some scripts (e.g., modules.py) may require additional setup (e.g., creating a module file) to run fully.
Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of Python.
Happy coding!
